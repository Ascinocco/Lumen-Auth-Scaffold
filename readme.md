# Lumen Auth Scaffold

This is a scaffold containg all the required files (Models, Migrations, Controllers, etc)
for having working token authentication from the get go with lumen 5.3 and jwt-auth 1.0.0-beta.1

I followed this tutorial: http://www.akaita.com/post/json-web-token-authentication-for-lumen-5-tymon-jwt-auth/
and modified it to best suit my needs
